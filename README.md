Modes for SubEthaEdit
=====================

SubEthaEdit is a text editor for Mac OS X, see http://www.subethaedit.net, providing collaborative working on documents.

It can be extended with "modes" in order to provide syntax highlighting, a
document structure view (e.g., list of functions or a program or section of a latex text), 
and even little tools written in AppleScript. One really cool feature is to copy selected 
text as XHTML to the clipboard, in order to paste it in an HTML document with syntax highlighting.

For some of my favorite programming languages, I have created simple modes for having
a quick look at some files, wihtout the need to start a full IDE, i.e. Eclipse.

The following languages are provided here:
- Xtend 2, see http://www.eclipse.org/xtend

The mode folders found in the repository are OS X packages. In order to install a model to your SubEthaEdit, 
simply double click the model package from the Finder.
